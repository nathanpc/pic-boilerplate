# Microchip PIC Project Boilerplate

This repository aims to create a boilerplate for Microchip PIC projects that are not dependent on their bloated [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide). This is my attempt to move away from that monstrosity and work in a environment that I enjoy a lot more.

Feel free to use this for your own projects and contribute to make this boilerplate even better.


## License

This is a boilerplate, so you should be free to do whatever you want with it. No strings attached. Because of the nature of the project I believe the most fitting license is the amazing [WTFPL](http://wtfpl.net/):
